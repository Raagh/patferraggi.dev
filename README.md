## patferraggi.dev

This is my personal website and blog. It was designed by my wife Sofia Toso @softoso. Its built with Gatsby, Sass, Netlify CMS and tested using Jest.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd patferraggi.dev/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `patferraggi.dev` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
